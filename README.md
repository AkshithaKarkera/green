  Solution Offered
  We identified Transactions will result in between
  a) Farmers   (Grow Sapplings) OWN and SELL all The digital assets or Redeem Yearly Sappling Voucehrs with Government
  b) Forest Department (Inspect Sapling) and issue YSR digital asset to revenue department for issue of Yearly Sappling Vouchers using automated Exchanges
  c)Revenue Department Issue KLAND digital record to farmers which monitors area of land used for deforestation and sapplings grown using the land: This data is vital and available in public network.
  d)Nurseries : Issue digital record of sapplings distributed to farmers
  
  Out of the Box Solutions
  The initial problem was addressing Deforestation 
  and We thought it will also provide unique innovative solution for farmers in addressing their debt trap
  We created a decentralised Exchange for farmers to liquidated their Yearly Sappling Vouchers for raising future finance
  We also suggest government of karnataka to create Similar kind of digital solutions for farmers in exchaning their produced goods.
